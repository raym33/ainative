# Contributing to AI Native OS

First off, thanks for considering contributing. This project is in its earliest stages, which means your input can genuinely shape what this becomes.

## Current State

We're in **Phase 0: Exploration**. This means:
- There's no codebase to hack on yet
- We're defining architecture and making foundational decisions
- Your ideas and feedback are as valuable as code right now

## How to Contribute

### Right Now (Phase 0)

1. **Join Discussions**
   - Share your ideas in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/raym33/ainative/discussions)
   - Comment on existing threads
   - Ask hard questions

2. **Open Issues**
   - Propose specific features or approaches
   - Point out problems with current ideas
   - Share relevant research or prior art

3. **Review and Critique**
   - Read through proposals and give feedback
   - Be constructively critical — we need people to tell us when ideas won't work

4. **Documentation**
   - Help document decisions as they're made
   - Write explanations of complex topics
   - Create diagrams or visualizations

### Later (When There's Code)

- Fork the repo
- Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
- Make your changes
- Write tests if applicable
- Submit a PR with a clear description

## What We're Looking For

### Skills Needed

| Area | Skills | Tasks |
|------|--------|-------|
| Kernel/Systems | C, Rust, Zig, Assembly | Kernel modifications, drivers, low-level optimization |
| AI/ML | Python, C++, CUDA/ROCm | Model optimization, inference engines, quantization |
| UI/UX | Design tools, CSS, JS | Shell design, interaction patterns, accessibility |
| Documentation | Technical writing | Architecture docs, tutorials, API references |
| Research | Academic background | Literature review, feasibility studies |

### Personality Types

- **Builders** — You want to write code and make things work
- **Architects** — You think about systems and how pieces fit together
- **Researchers** — You dig into papers and prior art
- **Critics** — You poke holes in ideas (constructively)
- **Communicators** — You explain complex things clearly

All are welcome and needed.

## Guidelines

### Code Style (for when we have code)

- Follow the style of surrounding code
- Write clear comments for non-obvious logic
- Include tests for new functionality
- Keep commits atomic and well-described

### Communication

- Be respectful and constructive
- Assume good intent
- Disagree with ideas, not people
- Back up opinions with reasoning or evidence

### Commit Messages

```
type: short description

Longer explanation if needed.

- Bullet points for multiple changes
- Reference issues with #123
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

### Pull Requests

- Keep PRs focused on a single change
- Write a clear description of what and why
- Link to relevant issues or discussions
- Be responsive to feedback

## Decision Making

For now, decisions are made through:
1. Discussion in GitHub Discussions or Issues
2. Rough consensus among active participants
3. Documentation of the decision and rationale

As the project grows, we'll formalize this process.

## Questions?

- Open a Discussion for general questions
- Open an Issue for specific technical questions
- Check existing threads — your question might be answered

## Code of Conduct

Be excellent to each other. More formally:

- Be welcoming and inclusive
- Be respectful of differing viewpoints
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully
- Focus on what's best for the project

We don't have a formal CoC document yet, but toxic behavior will result in being blocked from the project.
